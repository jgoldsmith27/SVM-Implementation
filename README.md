# SVM Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with three different kernel functions:
- Linear kernel
- Polynomial kernel
- RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel

The implementation includes experiments demonstrating the performance of these different kernel functions on various datasets.
